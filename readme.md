# Worksheets LaTeX files
For guidance on the basics of LaTeX, refer to [Overleaf -- Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) or the guide document in this respository.

## Compiling LaTeX Files

Find the appropriate LaTeX distribution for your OS on [The LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). After cloning this repository, you can open up `.tex` files in the corresponding editor to make edits and compile PDFs when you make updates.

TeXStudio is the recommended distribution for Linux. TeXLive and MacTeX are the reccomended distributions for Windows and MacOS respectively.

Overleaf may be used in a pinch, but you'll have to also upload any images if you want to compile them into your document. It is typically easier to go through one-time setup locally.
